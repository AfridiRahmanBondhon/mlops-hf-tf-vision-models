# MLOps with Vision Models (TensorFlow) from ðŸ¤— Transformers

This repository shows how to build Machine Learning pipeline for a vision model (TensorFlow) from ðŸ¤— Transformers using the TensorFlow Ecosystem. In particular, we use TensorFlow Extended(TFX), and there are TensorFlow Data Validation(TFDV), Transform(TFT), Model Analysis(TFMA), and Serving(TF Serving) besides TensorFlow itself internally involved.

We will show how to build ML pipeline with TFX in a step-by-step manner:
1. **Basic**: as the first step, we show how to build ML pipeline with the most basic components, which are `ExampleGen`, `Trainer`, and `Pusher`. These components are responsible for injecting raw dataset into the ML pipeline, training a TensorFlow model, and deploying a trained model.

2. **Intermediate**: as the second step, we show how to extend the ML pipeline from the first step by adding more components, which are `SchemaGen`, `StatisticsGen`, and `Transform`. These components are responsible for analyzing the structures of the dataset, analyzing the statistical traits of the features in the dataset, and data pre-processing.

3. **Advanced**: as the third setp, we show how to extend the ML pipeline from the second step by adding more components, which are `Resolver` and `Evaluator`. These components are responsible for importing existing Artifacts (such as previously trained model) and comparing the performance between two models (one from the `Resolver` and one from the current pipeline run).

4. **ðŸ¤— Hub Integration**: in this optional step, we show how to use custom TFX components for ðŸ¤— Hub. In particular, we use `HFModelPusher` to push currently trained model to ðŸ¤— Model Hub and `HFSpacePusher` to automatically deploy Gradio application to ðŸ¤— Space Hub.

5. **Organizing as a standalone Application**: TBD

6. **GitHub Integration**: TBD
